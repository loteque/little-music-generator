## Triggering the auto-deploy pipeline
_GitHub actions will trigger an autodeploy process when it detects a tag starting with "v", For Example:_ `v1.0.1`
<details>
  <summary>Commit as normal, push it, tag your commit, then push the tag:</summary>

* Commit your changes as normal, then tag the commit: ```git tag -a v1.0 -m "summary of release changes"```
* Push your changes with the tag: ```git push origin --tags```
* Github Actions will detect the new tag and trigger a new automated build of the game. 
* When it is done building it will auto-deploy an HTML5 Version to Github Pages.
* It will release all versions you have configured to build to Itch.io.

## GUT and git-LFS

<details>
  <summary> Optionally configure Godot Unit Testing (GUT) and/or git-LFS</summary>

## git-LFS(optional):
Before you push your first changes make sure you have git-lfs installed on your system:
https://git-lfs.github.com/
this template comes with a preconfigured .gitattributes file but feel free to add your own rules.
you must change the filename from gitattributes-template to .gitattributes

## GUT(optional):
Godot Unit Tests (GUT) is configured by default to run on pull requests to main. Tests are to be placed in res://test in either the res://test/unit or res://test/integration dirs. If you don't want to use tests just don't place tests there. For more information on GUT: https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Quick-Start

</details>
<hr>

## _Directory structure and best practices_
* the project/asset directory is where you keep all your game art, sound, etc... It can be tracked by git-lfs
* the project/src directory is where you keep the source-code. It should not be tracked by git-lfs.
